Hey I hope you have fun with this. Don't shoot your eye out.

Physical Building Notes
I used 5mm LEDs (https://amzn.to/3gkUEfk) with little metal LED holders (https://amzn.to/2TvnzTO)
I really prefer these HAPP-style buttons - https://amzn.to/36owiMY
Happ buttons are drilled with 1 1/8" drill bits.  Don't get the really aggressive Bosch ones.  Get this style.  https://amzn.to/3bZ478m
I used a combination of hot glue and 2 flat head #4 screws to attach the buttons to the ducks

Wire as follows

Buttons
One side of button to pin 1 (3.3v) and the other side to the pin below
Duck 0 - Pin 3
Duck 1 - Pin 5
Duck 2 - Pin 7
Duck 3 - Pin 11
Duck 4 - Pin 15

LEDs
Shorter leg of each of the LEDs to ground.
Longer leg to the pin through a 220 ohm or so resistor
Duck 0 - Pin 8
Duck 1 - Pin 10
Duck 2 - Pin 12
Duck 3 - Pin 16
Duck 4 - Pin 18

Node-Red
Before the sketch will run, you will need to add the following nodes through "Manage Palette"
- node-red-contrib-counter
- node-red-contrib-looptimer
- node-red-dashboard
- node-red-node-pi-gpio

To import the node red code, copy the entire contents of quack-attack-node-red.json to your clipboard.  Go into node-red
and go to Import->(clipboard) - Paste and hit okay.

Dashboard
To view the UI, visit http://your.pi.ip.address:1880/ui in any web browser on your network
If you are on the pi itself, open the web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:1880/ui

Playing Sounds
If you want to play sounds on the pi itself, you will need to install mpg123 from the terminal
sudo apt-get install mpg123

Choose whatever sound effects you want for quack and splat and copy quack.mp3 and splat.mp3 to
/home/dietpi/quack.mp3 and /home/dietpi/splat.mp3
Edit your path for your own configuration if you're using Raspbian or another OS.
