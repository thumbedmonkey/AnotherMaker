### Reset Modem

Sometimes (especially if you played with AT commands), your module configuration may become invalid. This may result in problems such as:

- Can't connect to the GPRS network
- Can't connect to the server
- Sent/received data contains invalid bytes
- etc.
To return module to Factory Defaults, use the ResetModem sketch.
