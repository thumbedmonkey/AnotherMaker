/*
Do whatever you want with this, but BE CAREFUL.  I'm not responsible. You'll shoot someone's eye out.
This is built on a Wemos D1 Mini
Since the Wemos output pins are 3v, I'm using a transistor to switch the 5v on the board on/off to fire the laser
Nearly any NPN Transistor would work, but I'm using a 2n222
When you're looking at the "flat" face of the transistor...

Left(1) - Emittor
Center(2) - Base
Right(3) - Collector
The wiring goes like this...
1. 5v pin on the wemos to the +(S) side of the laser
2. - Side of the laser to the Collector (right) side of the transistor.
3. Both one wire of the trigger AND the Emittor (left) side of the trasnistor go to Wemos Ground
4. The Base (center) of the transistor goes to pin D2 (AKA GPIO 4) on the Wemos
5. Pin D1 (AKA GPIO 5) goes to the other side of the pushbutton
