//This is for an Arduino mega, but obviously you can change your pin numbers for other boards

//Rather than constantly reprogramming the Arduino to add new features, I'm going to have the
//Ethernet shield hit a simple API on my computer that can play sound effects and process the
//secret. If you don't have a shield or don't want to do it this way, please use example 02.

//In this simple example, I have a server running xampp at 192.168.1.9
//There is a folder called /missioncontrol/api in my htdocs folder
//with an api file called index.php
//Note: In the server file there is a decently documented index.php with some sample sound files.
//It has instructions for win/mac/linux
