This is the home of my Apple ][ Gotek Adapter

I will eventually release the gerbers, but as a thank you, I am offering it on my PCBWay shared projects page only for a limited time. If you want to support me, please order it from there.

Thanks to the HxC firmware (currently free!) https://hxc2001.com/store/ for providing the software and especially to Jean-Fran√ßois over at HxC for all his hard work on the project.

IMPORTANT:
At the time of this publication, v2.5.6.6 of HxC Floppy Emulator for Converting my images.

There are 2 VERY important steps to converting existing files.  
1. Before you import, make sure you rename any files that are .dsk to .do so the software is clear that they are Apple files.  This will probably not be necessary in future versions.

2. When you export make sure that you export as "Rev 3 Experimental." This is the only version that works with the Apple ][ at the time I released this board..
