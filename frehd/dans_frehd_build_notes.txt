Update Feb 2, 2025
I made a little tool that makes adding your own files to the frehd in bulk much easier.  Check out import.py and import.mp4 in the root directory.

If you got a kit from me, all chips have been tested.
The PIC and GAL chips have been preprogrammed.

This file https://github.com/mudmin/AnotherMaker/blob/master/frehd/bom/REAL%20Part%20locations.txt
will tell you the proper locations to install your parts.

There are a few minor modifications. As you can see in this picture
https://github.com/mudmin/AnotherMaker/blob/master/frehd/frehd-pcb-mod.png

Q1 is not populated.  Instead a wire is soldered between the 2 pins as shown.
R15 is not populated. I filled in the extra holes with solder for clarity.

Be careful you don't bridge any pins when soldering the SD card reader.
Also be sure to solder the tabs on the sides as well as the corners and rear of the reader.

The LEDs are solderd with the short leg of the LED towards the snubbed off part of the circle on the led footprint

The electrolytic capacitors will mess with your brain a little bit, so be careful.  The PCB is marked with a
+ while caps are usually marked on the -.  So the line always goes AWAY from the +

Be careful when inserting chips that you don't curl the end legs underneath back up into the chip.

Before attaching the FreHD to the computer, power it with 5v separately (I usually splice a usb cord for the 5v);
The green LED should flash briefly when plugging it in (or within a few seconds) to let you know that all is
relatively well.

Many aftermarket power supplies come with a place to power the Frehd, but you can also splice into the lines that power
the floppy drives or run an external USB connector.

When you are installing the ribbon cable, the ones I made are designed so the red stripe faces the right when looking from
front of the computer.  Get it.  RED = RIGHT.

I like to feed the cable up between the motherboard and the shield for maximum neatness if I'm doing an internal install.
The process is documented here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-nj3amBGVz4PZ3ahkUwwwScRwPQDO_K4/view

If you 3d print an enclosure, I recommend installing it in the top drive bay.
This enclosure is great for taking up a full bay https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4169736

If you want to install a Gotek as well, this one is half Gotek and half FreHD. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4731543

Booting.  In the beginning, you will need a boot disk and an SD card in your FreHD.  I'm not an expert on these things,
but I can get you started.  My personal preference is to use a Gotek for the boot disk.
